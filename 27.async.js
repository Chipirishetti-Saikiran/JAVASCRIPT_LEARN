ðŸ”„ Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript
Asynchronous programming allows code to run without blocking other operations. Instead of waiting for a task to finish, 
JavaScript continues executing the next lines and handles the result later.

ðŸ”¹ Why Asynchronous?
JavaScript runs in a single thread, so long-running tasks (like API calls or file I/O) would freeze the entire page/app if done synchronously. 
Asynchronous code solves this by delegating tasks and handling results when they're ready.

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy
Ordering food at a restaurant:

You place the order (asynchronous task).

You donâ€™t wait idly â€” you keep talking or working.

When the food is ready, itâ€™s brought to you (callback or promise resolves).
