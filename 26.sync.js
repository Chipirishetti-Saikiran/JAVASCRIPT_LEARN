/*
Synchronous Programming in JavaScript
Synchronous programming means code is executed line by line, one after the other. Each operation must complete before the next one starts.

ðŸ”¹ Characteristics of Synchronous Code
Blocking â€“ each line waits for the previous one to finish.

Sequential Execution â€“ operations happen one after another.

Simple to Understand â€“ follows a top-to-bottom logic flow.
